## About me

My personal website. Some content may be in Russian.

I use Fedora Workstation (the one with GNOME) on my desktop systems and try to
configure everything with Ansible. Sometimes I convert stuff into RPM packages
with Fedora Copr and write shell scripts that make my life a bit easier.

I use Neovim for everything -- notetaking, editing code and even splitting terminal windows.

All information on this website is provided as is, if you break something while following my advice -- thats on you ðŸ‘½.
